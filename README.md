# LyndonString
Lynarr gets a string of length 1 to 20 as an input via the command line argument, for instance executing lynarr abbacd will “give” the program the string abbacd, while executing lynarr aabaabba will “give” the program the string aabaabba. The string is to be stored in a byte array in the program’s memory.
